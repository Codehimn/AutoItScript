Forum User BugFix - "And for easier managment of snippets, i've made the Snippet Editor. In snippets you must escape the dollar sign and the placeholder for cursorpositions are made with curly braces. But it makes a little bit confusing to read: "\$${1:varname}". So i'm using in Snippet Editor the following syntax for this: "$|1:varname|", for lonely placeholders "|1|". It will converted before saving the file."
